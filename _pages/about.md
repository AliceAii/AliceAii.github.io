Graduate student from University of California, Los Angeles.

Hello, it's so nice to meet you! My name is Shuhan Ai, but please feel free to call me "Alice." I am a Ph.D. student in the Higher Education and Organizational Change (HEOC) program at UCLA. As a first-generation college graduate and a woman of color, my journey in academia has shaped my passion for research and advocacy. My primary research interests focus on exploring the structural and cultural factors that influence the educational and career aspirations of underrepresented students, particularly women of color in STEM fields. I am also passionate about using quantitative research methods, including multinomial logistic regression, hierarchical linear modeling, structural equation modeling, and item response theory. Additionally, I enjoy leveraging quasi-experimental designs to examine potential outcomes and drive meaningful insights. Outside of my academic work, I love staying active and finding balance through playing table tennis, reading, and hiking. These hobbies bring me joy and help me recharge. I'm looking forward to connecting with you and learning from each other!
